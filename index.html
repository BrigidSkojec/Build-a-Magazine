      <h2>The Art of Doodling</h2>
      <p>Doodling isn’t just absent-minded scribbling — it’s spontaneous visual thinking. Whether you're drawing spirals in a margin or sketching weird little creatures during a meeting, doodles live in that space between boredom and imagination. It’s raw, unfiltered mark-making that often says more about your brain than a polished illustration ever could.</p>

      <h3>Why Doodling Is Good for You</h3>
      <p>Turns out, doodling isn’t a distraction — it’s cognitive glue. Studies show it helps with memory retention, focus, and stress relief. It keeps your brain engaged without overloading it. Think of it as mental fidgeting: your hand moves, your mind stays sharper. Plus, it’s one of the few creative outlets with zero pressure attached.</p>

      <h3>Quick Doodle Tips</h3>
      <p>Start with shapes — circles, triangles, blobs — and let them grow into something. Use a pen to keep yourself from obsessing over mistakes. Fill blank corners, borders, or even sticky notes. Don’t aim for pretty, aim for flow. The more you doodle without judging it, the more interesting your doodles get.</p>
